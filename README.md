 <h2>Introduction</h2> 
      <h3>About EDM Process<h3>
   <p>The present manufacturing environment is characterized by complexity, interdisciplinary
manufacturing functions and an ever growing demand for new tools and
techniques to solve difficult problems. </p>
   <p>The electrical discharge machining (EDM) process is the most popular among the non-conventional machining
processes. The erosion process of EDM is that the discharge sparks in gap generate enough heat to melt and even
vaporize some of the material on the surface of workpiece, so any difficult-to-cut material can be cut in EDM as
long as the material can conduct electricity.</p>

   <h3>Why ANN Model</h3>
   <p> <b>The complex nature of the process involves simultaneous
interaction of thermal, mechanical, chemical and electrical phenomena, which makes process model very difficult.so,A neural network is used to capture the general relationship between variables of a system that are difficult to relate analytically.<b>
</p>
   <p>But , we can map input vector([voltage , current, ton, toff ])  to output vector ([MRR,CD])   by using nonlinear statistical data modelling tools like Machine Learning , Deep Learning.
</p>
   <h3>Advantage of ANN model</h3>
      <p>If we want to find output parameter at particular(MRR,Crater depth)  input  parameter (voltage, current , Ton , Toff ) by <b>Finite Element Method<b>  then we have to do  simulation again & again in ANSYS, which will take:
</p>
        <ol> <li>More time</li>
           <li>Need a  very good  skilled worker for ANSYS SOFTWARE</li> <ol>
  <P>But by using Artificial Nural Netwok we can save </P>   
         <ol><li>Time</li><li>Need of  good skilled worker </li><li>Cost of ANSYS SOFTWARE and skilled worker</li></ol>
